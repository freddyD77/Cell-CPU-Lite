To test that the system works, use the tb_cellSPU.sv testbench. 
Also note that instructions are being loaded from instructions.txt into memory in the hardDisk.sv file.
The file directory in hardDisk.sv may have to be changed when running on your PC.
Also, the parser requires code to be written in a commands.txt file, so that it can create
the instructions.txt file for the system.
